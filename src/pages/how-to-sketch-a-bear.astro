    <p class="mb-6">
      Rendering a bear can be challenging for both beginners and advanced artists. This is especially true when using a photo reference instead of studying real animals in the wild. The issue with a flat photo reference is that the final drawing often lacks depth and anatomical accuracy. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this guide will help you draw realistic bears with confidence.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 1: Start with Simple Shapes</h2>
    <p>
      Start your sketch using a regular pencil and paper. Keep it simple ‚Äî use circles and ovals for the head and body, and light lines for legs and shoulders. Don‚Äôt focus on fur or shading yet; just define proportions and posture. Reference several photos to understand anatomy from multiple angles.

    </figure>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 2: Define the Bear‚Äôs Anatomy</h2>
    <p>
      Lightly outline muscle groups and joints. Notice how the shoulders and hips align when the bear walks. Keep lines loose and fluid ‚Äî bears have strong necks and thick torsos. Don‚Äôt worry about perfection yet; focus on understanding structure.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 3: Add Fur and Details</h2>
    <p>
      Once the form feels correct, use short strokes to represent fur. Apply longer, darker lines along the back and limbs. Keep the strokes in the direction of fur growth for realism.
    </p>

      class="rounded-xl shadow-lg mx-auto my-8"
    />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 4: Refine and Shade</h2>
    <p>
      Add shading with the light source in mind (for example, top-left). Use gradual tones to define muscles and mass. Adding ground shadows and grass details near the paws helps your drawing feel grounded and natural.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Art Tips for Realism</h2>
    <ul class="text-left mx-auto max-w-xl list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Watch nature videos to observe how bears move.</li>
      <li>Keep your early lines loose; tighten them only when proportions look right.</li>
      <li>Use a mirror to check symmetry.</li>
      <li>Use cross-hatching or blending to shade around the neck and under the belly.</li>
    </ul>
