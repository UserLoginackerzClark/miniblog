    <p class="mb-6">
      Rendering a bear can be quite challenging, for both beginners and advanced artists. This is especially true if you are using a photo reference, and do not spend much time out in the wild studying and drawing animals. The issue with using a photo or digital image is its flat, and often times the finished drawing is missing important anatomical details, giving your subject an awkward appearance. It would of be ideal if a bear could sit still and pose or us, but that is never going to happen.  But don't not worry about that! I have some drawing tricks to help you get around this complication, and how to guide you thru the process of rendering a bear, and keeping it looking natural and realistic.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 1: Start your sketch with just a simple pencil and paper.</h2>

    <p>
      There's no need to spend a lot of money on materials, and no need to get fancy. Just start a basic outline using some circles to represent the body, head and nose. Don't worry about details at this point, that will come later. Your main focus at this stage is keep it simple, and think about how the subject matter fits into a square shaped page. Also, you should have a several different photo references, with different of your bear. The reason for using several different images is it shows important details that are otherwise hidden from a flat image. These images will be your guide for all anatomical details.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 2: Define the Bear’s Anatomy</h2>
    <p>
      Sketch lightweight pencil lines to outline muscle groups and joints. Notice how the shoulders and hips align during a walking pose. Pay attention to the animals weight balance, bears are powerful animals, and your sketch should show a thick neck and shoulders.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 3: Add Fur and Details</h2>
    <p>
      Once you’re satisfied with the form, add short directional strokes for fur texture. 
      Use softer lines around the belly and face, and darker, longer strokes along the back and legs for contrast.
