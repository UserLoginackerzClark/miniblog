    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 1: Start with Basic Shapes</h2>
    <p>
      Begin your bear sketch with circles and ovals to map out the head, body, and limbs. 
      Lightly connect the forms to build a sense of volume. Don’t worry about details yet — focus on getting the proportions right.
    </p>

    />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 2: Define the Bear’s Anatomy</h2>
    <p>
      Use light contour lines to outline muscle groups and joints. Notice how the shoulders and hips align during a walking pose. 
      Pay attention to the weight balance — bears are powerful animals, and your sketch should show that grounded strength.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Step 3: Add Fur and Details</h2>
    <p>
      Once you’re satisfied with the form, add short directional strokes for fur texture. 
      Use softer lines around the belly and face, and darker, longer strokes along the back and legs for contrast.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Art Tips for Realism</h2>
    <ul class="text-left mx-auto max-w-xl list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Observe references of bears walking or resting in nature videos.</li>
      <li>Keep your lines loose at first — tightening too soon makes sketches stiff.</li>
      <li>Work from large to small shapes for better proportion control.</li>
      <li>Use cross-hatching to shade areas like under the neck and between the legs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Learning how to sketch a bear trains your eye for anatomy, rhythm, and texture. 
      Whether you’re creating wildlife art or practicing animal anatomy, sketching bears sharpens your observation skills and brings life to your drawings.
